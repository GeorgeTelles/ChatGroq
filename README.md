# ChatGroq - AI Chatbot in Python

ChatGroq is an AI-powered chatbot built in Python that runs locally on your computer using the **Groq API**. It leverages the **LangChain** framework to streamline interactions with a large language model.

## üîπ Features
- **Groq API Integration**: Requires an API key from Groq (which was free).
- **LangChain-Based**: Uses **LangChain** for structured prompts and response handling.
- **AI Model**: Powered by **LLaMA 3 (8B - 8192)**.
- **Message History**: Maintains a simple in-session conversation history.
- **Local Execution**: Runs entirely on your computer via the terminal, without external servers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. The user enters a message in the terminal.
2. The chatbot processes the input and sends it to the Groq API.
3. The AI model generates a response and returns it to the user.
4. The conversation history is stored within the program session.
5. The chat can be exited by typing **"exit"**.

ChatGroq is a great project for experimenting with AI chatbots without relying on paid services or complex cloud solutions. üöÄ
